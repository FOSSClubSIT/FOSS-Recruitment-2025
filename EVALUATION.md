# Evaluation — FOSS Recruitment 2025

Don’t worry if you are a fresher or new to coding.  
We care more about **effort, clarity, and completing your project** than about perfect code.

---

## What We Look At

1. **Git Usage (20 pts)**
   - Did you use a proper branch (`lastname_firstname`)?
   - Are your commits clear and meaningful?
   - Did you make a proper Pull Request?

2. **Documentation (20 pts)**
   - Does your README explain what you built?
   - Does it have clear steps to run your project (especially offline)?
   - Did you list AI tools or APIs used?

3. **Code Quality (25 pts)**
   - Is your code easy to read and understand?
   - Is the project organized (folders, files)?
   - Basic error handling or simple testing is a plus.

4. **Creativity (20 pts)**
   - Is the idea original or thoughtful?
   - Does it solve a problem in an interesting way?

5. **Completion (15 pts)**
   - Did you finish something that works within 24 hours?
   - Even a small working project is better than an incomplete big one.

## Special Notes
- **AI Tools**: Allowed and encouraged! Just mention them in your README.  
- **APIs**: Optional. If used, provide sample data so your project runs offline.  
- **Beginners**: Don’t stress about perfect code. Focus on finishing and explaining your thought process.

## Score Guide
- **80–100 pts** → Strong Accept  
- **65–79 pts** → Accept if team fit is good  
- **Below 65 pts** → Not accepted this time, but may be considered for mentorship.

## Final Note
This evaluation scheme is meant to be **friendly and achievable**.  
If you follow the instructions (branching, commits, README, and finishing your project),  
you should easily score **at least 50 points**.  
The extra marks come from creativity, clarity, and polish.
