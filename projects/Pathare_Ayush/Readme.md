## Future Improvements
Write how you would improve this project if you had more time.  

I initially wanted to add a sound effect alarm once the timer gets to zero and the screen to give a fade-in fade-out red color flash effect, however after several attempts I had to discard the feature since it was breaking other parts of code which I wasn't able to fix with my current skillbase.

But I'm pretty sure it is a very doable feature and can be added with more time at hand. I need to improvise further on my skill set of the domain to add the programmming for it.

## Notes for Reviewers
Just need to clone the files locally and run the `index.html` file in a brwoser.

Also, I realised I missed adding a feature to go back to 25-Mins timer from 5 Min timer, but another trick to do that is press F5.
 (Yeah, it should definitely be working that way)
