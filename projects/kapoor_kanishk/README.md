## Problem Statement
In open-source communities like GitHub, the README.md file is the front door to a project. 
A poorly written or incomplete README creates a high barrier for new users and potential contributors, 
who may abandon the project if they can't understand its purpose, how to install it, or how to use it. 
This leads to good projects being overlooked and slows down community collaboration. 
This tool aims to solve that problem by providing developers with a fast, automated way 
to check their documentation against FOSS best practices.

## Core Features
- Best Practice Analysis: Checks README files for essential sections that are critical for a healthy open-source project.

- Specific Checks: Validates the presence of a Title, Description, Installation instructions, Usage examples, License information, and Contribution guidelines.

- Instant Feedback & Scoring: Provides an immediate, color-coded report card in the terminal and calculates a final quality score.

- Constructive Suggestions: For each failed check, the linter offers a clear suggestion on how to improve the README.

- Completely Safe & Offline: The script only reads files and never modifies the user's system. It runs entirely offline with no external dependencies.

- Command-Line Interface (CLI): Easy to use directly from the terminal, with a built-in demo mode for first-time users.
