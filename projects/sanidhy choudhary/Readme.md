## Problem Statement
NeuroHarmony bridges the gap between mental states and music by translating brain signals into music or soundscapes.
---

## Features
Real-Time Brainwave Monitoring
Connect to EEG headsets (e.g., Muse, Emotiv) to capture brainwave data.

Signal Processing
Analyze EEG data (e.g., alpha, beta, theta waves) to determine mood, focus, or stress levels.

Music Generation Engine
Convert brainwave patterns into MIDI or audio using generative algorithms.

Visualization Dashboard
Show current brain states with real-time graphs or mood indicators.

Preset Modes
Relaxation, focus, creativity, sleep, etc., using adaptive soundscapes.

History and Analytics
Track daily mood/music correlation and brain activity trends.

Custom Sound Design
Users can select instruments, tempo, or genre preferences.
