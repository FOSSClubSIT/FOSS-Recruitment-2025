## Problem Statement
Just wanted to check if I remembered how to make a basic game in python. It's just a simple escape the projectiles, as you try to make your way out of hell. The difficulty rampus up the further away you get.
---

## Features
- Can show the highest level the player has reached
- Power-Ups are present
- The background moves with the playable character, giving it a realistic feeling
---

## Tech Stack
Python, and pygame module downloaded seperately.(Decent at python, had to use AI for a lot of parts I had no idea about.)

---

## How to Run  
1. Open the folder in VS Code.  
2. Run `pythonmainfinal5.py`  
3. Make sure to have pygame module installed.

## Future Improvements
I would like to add custom sprites, along with custom worlds and more backgrounds. Would love to add something like a boss battle too of some sort. Cleaning up the code and making it run smoother could also be in the works.
