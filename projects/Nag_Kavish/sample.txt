Free and Open Source Software, or FOSS, allows users to run, study, and modify software freely. 
It encourages collaboration and community-driven development. 
Many popular tools like Linux, Python, and Firefox are FOSS projects. 
Unlike proprietary software, FOSS provides transparency and control to the user. 
Students and developers benefit from FOSS by learning directly from the source code. 
Overall, FOSS plays a vital role in innovation and knowledge sharing.
