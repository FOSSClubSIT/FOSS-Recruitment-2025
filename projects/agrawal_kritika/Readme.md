## Problem Statement
It is often difficult for individuals to keep track of their daily moods and emotions. Remembering how we felt and why on a given day can help in mental wellness and self-reflection.
This project solves that by allowing users to record their daily mood and notes, and view them later on a calendar-based timeline.
---

## Features
- Choose your mood from 10 emoji-based options.
- Write a short note to reflect on your day.
- Motivational or supportive quotes appear depending on your mood.
- Calendar view shows daily moods with emojis.

## Tech Stack

CSS – Styling & responsive design
JavaScript – Functionality, event handling, calendar logic

2. Open the folder in VS Code (or any editor).
3. Simply open index.html in any modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox).
4. Start tracking your moods!
